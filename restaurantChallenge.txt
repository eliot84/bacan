PRACTICE ACTIVITY: In Class

THE RESTAURANT CHALLENGE
Make a webpage for a new restaurant that you have created. This will be a multi-page site you may borrow text content from another source for this exercise if needed. Priority should be on completing the site. We will learn CSS soon to help with the actual layout design of our sites, but for this exercise focus more on functionality.

SCAVENGER HUNT: Always figure out your content before you begin building your site
Before we begin coding, lets brain storm and put together content for the site. Take 5 minutes to review the following:

1. What type of restaurant will your site be about?
2. What is the name of your restaurant?
3. Create a brief introduction about your newly created restaurant (what is the restaurant about and why should people go?)
4. Obtain an image representing your restaurant or food related to your restaurant
5. Create a list of Appetizers, Meals and Desserts (5 items per section)
6. Obtain 1 picture to represent each category listed: Appetizers, Meals and Desserts
7. Create 2 Fake reviews and fake authors for your restaurant
8. Create a list of foods that your clients highly recommend from most loved to least (5 items only can be anything in your appetizers, meals or desserts list)
